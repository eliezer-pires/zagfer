// Mock types locally if needed or just use 'any' for quick verify since we can't import types easily in pure JS runner unless we compile.
// We will rely on static check or just inspecting the code structure. 
// Actually since pdfService is TS, we can't run it directly with 'node' without compiling.
// The best verification here is manual as per plan, but I can check for syntax errors by creating a small check script if I could run TS.
// Since I cannot run TS directly easily in this environment without setup, I will rely on the user to verify manually or check build status.

// Let's check for build errors in frontend.
